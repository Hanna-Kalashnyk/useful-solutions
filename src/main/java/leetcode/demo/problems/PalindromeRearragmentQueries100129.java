/**
 * 100129. Palindrome Rearrangement Queries
 * User Accepted:49
 * User Tried:659
 * Total Accepted:52
 * Total Submissions:1315
 * Difficulty:Hard
 * You are given a 0-indexed string s having an even length n.
 *
 * You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array, queries, where queries[i] = [ai, bi, ci, di].
 *
 * For each query i, you are allowed to perform the following operations:
 *
 * Rearrange the characters within the substring s[ai:bi], where 0 <= ai <= bi < n / 2.
 * Rearrange the characters within the substring s[ci:di], where n / 2 <= ci <= di < n.
 * For each query, your task is to determine whether it is possible to make s a palindrome by performing the operations.
 *
 * Each query is answered independently of the others.
 *
 * Return a 0-indexed array answer, where answer[i] == true if it is possible to make s a palindrome by performing operations specified by the ith query, and false otherwise.
 *
 * A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
 * s[x:y] represents the substring consisting of characters from the index x to index y in s, both inclusive.
